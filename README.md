MYSQL-Creator
=============

Create a mysql user, database and password from a shell script.

Put this in a directory of your choosing, I personally but it in /home/user.

Make the file executable by typing chmod 755 createdatabase.sh

Run the file by typing ( cd dir && ./createdatabase.sh init ) 'dbname' 'username' 'password'
